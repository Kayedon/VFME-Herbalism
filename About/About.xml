<b>VFME - Herbalism!</b>

A brand new mod by Vanilla Fan Made Expanded! Herbalism brings powerful neolithic and medieval elixirs and tonics, using almost entirely Vanilla resources.

With Herbalism, flowers sown for Beauty now have another use - harvesting their petals and stems for use in herbology. These bundles are entirely interchangeable, use random flower graphics on harvest, but all stack into one item.

Featuring:
- Elixir of Euphoria, an addictive treatment for bad moods. Provides a powerful +60 mood buff, at the cost of any usefulness for your pawn.
- Elixir of Purity, a vomit-inducing concoction that rapidly induces a deep slumber from which nothing can wake, purging the system of - infections almost overnight.
- Elixir of Rush, a mildly addictive combat drug, with a drawback. After the initial state of concentration wears off, a period of sedation sets in.
- Tonic of Immunity, a blend of healroot and agave leaves, dulls the senses but aids in defence against infection.
- Tonic of Health, a simple blend that helps to ward off some illnesses, but is rather unpleasant to consume.
- Tonic of Satioety, a disgusting concoction that causes painful stomach cramps, but almost entirely nullifies the need for food.
- If Royalty is loaded, an Elixir of Anima is available, crafted by trimming anima fibers from an anima tree. Provides a temporary, powerful boost to psychic sensitivity. The strength of this drug leads to a debilitating headache as it wears off, almost entirely nullifying psychic sensitivity.
